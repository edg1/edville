This module provides extra features that extend the Services module.  These currently include:

1. A Search API web service that accepts parameters for search terms, facets, index, sort order, result limit, offset, and result format
2. Node, comment, and user web services with simplified result formats.  No Drupal 'und' arrays.  Good for non-Drupal frontends.
3. A global settings web service.
4. LDAP authentication support for the Services module login resource
5. Alter hooks for service results
6. Services definition page for all enabled services
